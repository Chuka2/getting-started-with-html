    My name is <b>Chukwuka Okwumabua</b> and these are my <b>Stage 0</b> notes.
<br> <br><br>Two tools very helpful in practicing coding are <b><em>Scratchpad</em></b> and <b><em>Codepen</em></b><br>
<br> A computer programmer thinks in 5 ways<br>
<b>1)</b><em>Procedural Thinking</em> - creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow
<br><b>2)</b><em>Abstract Thinking</em> - finding similarity/generality amongst seemingly different things. Helps avoid repitition of work by using abstarction.
<br><b>3)</b><em>System Thinking</em> - Break a big problem down into smaller pieces
<br><b>4)</b><em>Technological Empathy</em> - Ability to understand what a computer is and how it works. What it is good and bad at doing "stupid".
<br><b>5)</b><em>Debugging</em> - Systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.
<br> --- System for fixing problem is: collect evidence, generate theories, test the theories, Fix the problem.<br><br>
Basics of the web: The web is made up of HTML <EM>(Hypertext Markup Language)</EM>documents. The glue is the links between the pages.
<br>Types of files on the web include: <b>Plain Text, Images, HTML, Video </b><br>
The web chain consistsof the user, the browser, the internet and the servers.<br><br>
HTML files are requested by HTTP<em>(Hypertest Transfer Protocol)</em> requests.<br><br>
HTML documents consist of:<br>
1) Text content - what you see
<br>2) Markup - what it looks like, arrangement<br>
3)References to other documents<br>
4)Links to other pages
<br><br>
HTML Markup uses <b>Tags</b> to modify contentin the document.
<br> Opening tags and closing tags, and everything encompassed constitutes the <b><em>Element.</em></b>
<br><br>
examples of tags are < b > < /b >, < em > < /em ><br><br>
There are also <b>HTML Attributes</b> e.g < Tag  ATTR = "Value"  > < /Tag ><br><br>
The  <em>Anchor</em> tag uses attributes to create/rename URL hot links.<br>
e.g < a  href  =  "www.xxxxx.com"  >  Rush  <  /a  >   this will make the word <em> Rush </em> a hot link to the URL in the first part of the element.
<br>
In the same way,  <  img   Src  =  "url"  alt   =  "text"  > will place an image in an HTML document and place text describing the image in its place if the image can't be dispalyed.<br>
***It is required to have the substitute text for failed images.<br><br>
Whitespace and breaks between lines are created using the tag <  br  >
<br><br>
The <b><em>Paragraph</em></b> Tag also creates breaks but is a different type of tag. <  p  > < /p >
<br>
The Paragraph, div, and form tags are all called <b>Block</b> Tags because they form a block around the content in their element.
<br>
The Span, anchor, break, image and strong tags are called <b>Inline</b> Tags.<br><br>
The HTML document structure is:<br>
<  !  DocType  HTML  ><br>
<   html   ><br>
<    head    ><br>
<   title   >   Title  !  <  /title   ><br>
<   /head   ><br>
<    body    ><br>
<  b  > content   <   /b   > <br>
<   / body   ><br>
<   /html   >
    
    
    
    
    
  </body>
</html>
